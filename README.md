## My process

With the HTML basic content provided, worked on:
  - assigning CSS class names using the BEM method
  - used SASS for the first time
  - creating variables in SASS for color schemes, fonts, font-sizes, etc
  - adding Google Fonts provided
  - a quick CSS reset with a couple lines of CSS

Next worked on:
  - built mobile first
  - Adding background image for header in the card
  - Figuring out where to use Flex vs Grid (used both)
  - Worked on media query for tablet/desktop
  
Finally worked on:
  - Creating a Table of Contents for my SASS/CSS files.
  - Minifying my CSS file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- SASS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A lot of this was review and putting in the work. I did use SASS for the first time.  This was a great project to start learning it.  This time I learned simply SASS basics like format and variables.  

### Continued development

After using SASS, I really enjoyed working with the SASS syntax.  In the future I will work on @mixins, @import, etc to maximize even more the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor.

### Useful resources

- [Jen Simmons Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ2JX_6SGNI) - Super smart person who loves CSS Grid.  She does amazing little projects and shows the power of Grid.  This specific video showcases max-content and min-content which helped me with this project. 
- [Kevin Powell Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/kepowob) - I watch this guys stuff constantly.  He has one of the best consistent channels mostly concentrating on CSS.  Wonderful resource.
